# script to collide JPEG2000 files
# Ange Albertini, December 2018

# as JP2 seems to enforce some atoms, a generic "atom/box" prefix starting with a `free` atom can't work.
# it needs a specific prefix that starts like a jp2 file.
# besides, the logic is the same as MP4. just no need to relocate anything.
